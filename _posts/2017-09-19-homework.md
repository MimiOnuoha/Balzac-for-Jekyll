Hi I did my homework and this is what I decided to do. Here is the code for it. 

```
shorter_terms = []
for item in term_list:
	if len(item) < 10:
		shorter_terms.append(item)

print shorter_terms
```

Here is something I learned from it. It was great. Thank you Mimi for assigning me homework, I appreciate it.
